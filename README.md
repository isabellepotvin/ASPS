# ASPS

During my co-op term at Statistics Canada, I was assigned to work on a web application called The Area Sampling and Production System (ASPS) that serves as the sampling system for the Labor Force Survey. More specifically, I was tasked with creating the high-fidelity prototype for the Create Design feature of the application. This feature will be used by Sampling Methodologists at Statistics Canada. It uses stratification and allocation file inputs to produce a “design” that identifies the specific locations within cities across Canada and timeframes for samples to be drawn and used for the monthly Labour Force Survey.

A coworker of mine created wireframes for the Create Design web pages based on research and elaboration meetings with the client. My job was to create a web-based prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on the wireframe designs. This involved developing four webpages:
- a home page to launch the Create Design feature
- an input form page where the user can provide the input files and specific design parameters to create the design
- an output page that displays summary statistics for the design
- a page to display and manage the designs that are created

Since I was responsible for the front-end development of the pages, I coded the basic look of the page using HTML and CSS. This included populating the HTML document with various tags and text, and styling the page using common CSS layout properties such as padding, border, flex-box, etc. I also implemented some basic functionality using JavaScript such as tabs, modals, and tooltips. Additionally, I had to ensure that I was building these pages while keeping in mind that they need to be accessible to people with disabilities. This consisted of maintaining a good page structure, using appropriate tags and adding in ARIA attributes where needed.

My HTML work was reviewed by the ASPS team to ensure that all required functionality was incorporated and presented appropriately. Minor updates were made to the HTML pages based on feedback from the review process. Once this process was complete, it was then the developers’ responsibility to implement the back-end functionality.
